In accordance with MEPS data documentation rules, records with missing, negative, or inapplicable values (such as -1, -7, or -9) were flagged as NA. In order to facilitate interpretation and maintain consistency across analyses, variables indicating demographic factors (age, sex, race/ethnicity, income group), insurance status (private, public, uninsured), and chronic diseases (diabetes, hypertension, cancer) were given new labels where needed.\nThe TOTEXP23 variable, which represents total annual expenditures from all payment sources, was used to record healthcare expenditures. The MEPS Full Year Consolidated Data Codebook was used to identify demographic variables (such as insurance status, chronic diseases, etc.). To account for the complex survey design and guarantee nationally representative findings, MEPS survey weights (PERWT23F) were included in all analyses.\nFull cleaning and data exploration are provided on the “About the Data” page."
